# Frontend project boilerplate

This boilerplate is heavily influenced from the wonderful job done from the great team at [SweetAlert2](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2).

The aim is to provide a boilerplate with minimal configuration for front end projects development, using:

* Gulp 
* Babel
* Testing with:
  * Karma
  * QUnit

It provides basic set-up for:

* Live server with autoreload
* Transpiling
* Linting
* Browser testing
